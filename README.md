# Basic Facial Recognition:
Facial Recognition System by using Dimensionality Reduction (Unsupervised Learning). The following are images depicting the process:


## The Average face of the Training images

## The first six(6) eigen-faces of the system:

## Accuracy Rate of 78% and 80% from Testing set1 and set2 respctively:
faces with a red shade where wrongly identified and the gray images where identified correctly.
